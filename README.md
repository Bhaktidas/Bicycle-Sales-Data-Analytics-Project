## Project Description

The Cycle Sales Data Analytics project is a data analysis project that aims to help a cycle sales company make informed decisions about its sales and inventory management. The project uses Excel and Power BI for data normalization and analysis, providing a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding cycle sales data.

The project uses a dataset containing information on the company's cycle sales, including the date of the sale, the type of cycle sold, the price, and the location of the sale. The data is stored in an Excel file, and Power BI is used for data normalization and visualization.

The project includes a range of data analysis techniques, including descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and time-series analysis. These techniques are used to identify trends and patterns in the data, predict future sales, and optimize inventory management.

The project also includes interactive visualizations and dashboards, allowing the user to explore the data and gain insights into the company's sales performance. The visualizations are designed to be easy to use and interpret, even for non-technical users.

The Cycle Sales Data Analytics project is an open-source project, available on GitHub for anyone to download, use, and contribute to. The project is compatible with Excel 2016 or later and Power BI Desktop.

Overall, the Cycle Sales Data Analytics project aims to provide a powerful tool for cycle sales companies to analyze their sales data and make informed decisions about inventory management and sales performance. By leveraging the power of Excel and Power BI, the project can help companies to optimize their operations and improve their bottom line.



## Overview
This project involves data cleaning and analysis of customer data for a fictional online retailer. The purpose of this project is to provide insights into customer behavior, identify key customer segments and opportunities for growth, and ultimately improve customer retention and revenue.
## Methodology
The project was carried out in three main phases:

1.Data Quality ASsessment: Assesment of data quality and complitness in preparation for analysis where the raw customer data was cleaned and organized using Microsoft Excel. This included removing duplicate entries, correcting errors and inconsistencies, and formatting the data for analysis.

2.Data insights: Targeting high value customer demographics and attributes where RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was performed to segment the customer base and identify key customer groups. This involved calculating each customer's recency (how recently they made a purchase), frequency (how often they make purchases), and monetary value (how much money they spend).

3.Data Insight and Presentation: A dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize the results of the analysis and provide insights into customer behavior. The dashboard includes interactive visualizations of customer segments, purchase trends, and revenue metrics.
